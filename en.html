                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>We, Quentin from Switzerland and Hannah from Hong Kong, met in YWAM (Youth With A Mission) Backpack DTS at the beginning of 2024. During our DTS (Discipleship Training School) in Rogaland, Norway, we connected and shared our visions.</p>
                    
                    <p>We became close friends from the very beginning, along with another Brazilian girl. We enjoyed having deep conversations and became best friends.</p>
                    
                    <p>After DTS, we started dating, and we plan to marry in January and February 2025 in our respective home countries.</p>

                        <h3>My Testimony</h3>
                        <p>My name is Quentin and I'm from Switzerland.</p>
                        
                        <p>I've known about Jesus since childhood through my parents and gave Him my life in my pre-teen years, but I never truly understood or had a real relationship with Him until I was almost 30. I attended church for many years, serving as staff in the youth group, but then drifted away from church and God for a long time.</p>
                        
                        <p>I never knew exactly what I wanted to do in life, but I always wanted to serve a good cause, doing something meaningful. I studied and worked in various fields but never felt I was doing anything truly useful. It didn't satisfy me or answer what I felt deep in my heart.</p>
                        
                        <p>In early Summer 2023, I lost almost everything I had tried to build by myself. Finally, I gave everything to God, started a real and deep relationship with Him, and made Him King of my heart. Eager to know Him more and build my life with Him, I decided to attend a DTS with YWAM to establish a strong foundation for my life with the Lord.</p>

                        <p>Everything I experienced during DTS (classes, outreach, fellowship, my growing relationship with God, and more) helped me realize how much I want to serve God and His Kingdom - this is what my heart always needed. I especially felt and heard God calling me to serve in Asia as a missionary. Before this, if someone had told me I would become a missionary, I wouldn't have believed them, thinking it wasn't for me or that I wasn't good enough or gifted for such work.</p>

                        <p>But I learned to know myself better and find my true identity in Christ. I also learned there are many ways to serve God and His Kingdom as missionaries.</p>

                        <p>Recently, I realized that even when I wasn't close to God, He was close to me, preparing my heart for years to serve Him for His glory. He also prepared my partner and best friend Hannah, so we can go together as a family. I thank God every day for this amazing woman with whom we can be a great team (God, her, and me).</p>

                        <p>A month before my DTS, I had a dream from God where I saw the map of Japan and the city of Oita, but at that time, I didn't understand it and just filed it away, knowing nothing about YWAM or Oita then.</p>

                        <p>One day, when the base leader discussed possibilities in YWAM after DTS, I looked through the list of bases around Asia on the website, and my eyes went straight to Oita. I immediately heard God calling me there. So I contacted the base, and a few months after DTS, Hannah and I were accepted as staff there. We are now preparing for our wedding and everything else needed to go to Oita, hopefully in March 2025.</p>

                        <h3>My Testimony</h3>
                        <p>My name is Hannah, and I was born in a Christian family. By His grace, my parents and my sister's family have served God faithfully for many years. For me, I had been given the heart for serving and missions when I was a young teenager. My spiritual life's growth was full of ups and downs in my teens, but He is the faithful one!</p>

                        <p>I was called to be a missionary in 2018 when I was in South Korea. During prayer time, the Pastor asked everyone who wanted to receive a calling to come to the stage. I was touched and kept praying in my seat. I prayed to God, sharing my long-time desire for missions, and asked Him to lead me. I always had a heart for missions and it keeps growing. Since then, I've tried different ways to walk close to the nations and people. While facing many challenges, God reformed me and kept guiding me to prepare myself for the day I would be sent out to a place where I can serve.</p>

                        <p>In early 2024, I joined DTS with YWAM in Norway. During this time, I deeply heard and felt that God was truly guiding me to a place and would bring me to people who need Jesus. One day, one of our teachers prayed for me and said that God had already put 'Asia' in my heart and that I was anointed to serve the lost somewhere in Asia. After the prayer, I kept praying and asking God to maintain my fire for 'going out for God'. In DTS, I met my life partner whom God prepared for me, Quentin, a Swiss who has a heart for missions in Asia, especially Japan. God kept speaking to me in different situations and answered my prayers. My first prayer to God was to keep my future relationship and mission in the same pace - I wanted a man who was ready for missions. Knowing Quentin had a heart for Japan and was willing to serve after DTS, my second prayer was that I would go wherever God called me, not just following someone.</p>

                        <p>During outreach, my team went to Vietnam to serve locals, evangelize, and visit local churches. I met two missionaries in different churches, and both mentioned serving IN JAPAN! I was like 'ahhhhh!!!!!!' Thank you, God, for the sign that I know is from You, showing me where You're sending me as a missionary. After all these amazing experiences, at the end of DTS, I told Quentin my prayers and what God had told me. We waited until graduation and then started dating.</p>

                        <p>I saw how faithful our God is, how He talks to people who are willing to listen, how His plans are higher than mine, and how He is leading Quentin and me as a family to Japan, the first nation in our missionary life.</p>

                        <p>In July, during the first month of our long-distance dating, we sent staff applications to YWAM Oita Japan seeking an opportunity to serve. The process took time - application review, background checks, reference forms - and finally, in mid-October, we received their welcome email officially accepting us as a missionary couple! Praise the Lord, He never lets me down! He is the faithful ONE, He is the real God. Now, in late October, we've finally started preparing to raise support and obtain Japanese missionary visas.</p>

                        <p>Our missionary life is just beginning, and I hope you also feel led to walk with us on this lifelong journey. We look forward to seeing His plans unfold!</p>

                    <h2>How We Got Called to Mission</h2>
                    <p>Both of us felt called to serve in Asia before we met each other. God called us through prayers and dreams, specifically leading us to Oita - God gave Quentin a vision showing him the map of Japan and the name of the city Oita.</p>
                    
                    <p>We believe God always has a plan for each step, and we are open to every future plan from Him. We are truly blessed that God showed us this first step as missionaries going to Oita.</p>

                    <h2>What Will We Do in Japan?</h2>
                    <p>The YWAM base in Oita is involved in campus evangelisation ministry, arts ministry, running a school for kids, and the first DTS in this city will start in April 2025. There will be many opportunities to serve and connect with the local community.</p>
                    
                    <p>Initially, we'll focus on settling in, getting to know and serving alongside the base staff. It would be a pleasure if we could help with the upcoming DTS too!</p>
                    
                    <p>During two video calls with the base staff, we felt warmly welcomed, and they shared that we would have various opportunities to try different ministries. We're excited to discover more about our gifts and what God calls us to do.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're eager to begin this exciting journey!</p>
